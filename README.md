# C964
Quick Start Guide
To launch, click the "launch binder" button below. A docker container will gather together the dependencies and code into an image and deploy it to a server where you can interact with the model through the browser. Please allow time for this process to occur. If there are any issues with startup, please return here and relaunch.
